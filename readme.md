# UMDWrap

Wrap compiled Haxe JS output for use as a self-contained module compatible with [UMD](https://github.com/umdjs/umd) (Universal Module Definition) patterns.

Fields exposed in Haxe with the `@:expose` metadata will be available in the module. 

Creates modules that will work with AMD (requirejs) or CommonJS, and will expose any exports to globally if those options are not available.

See `run-examples.bat` and the `example/` folder for basic usage examples.

If you need it, `nekotools boot UMDWrap.n` will create an executable version of the tool.

Based on the templates at https://github.com/umdjs/umd
